# Celestial Local Area Network Launcher

## Introduction

Celestial Empire Local Area Network (LAN) Launcher. (天朝局域网接入器)

This project is not a virus, just for MOCKING CELESTIAL EMPIRE'S NET SELF-ISOLATION BEHAVIOR.

As is well known, there is an invisible and intangible wall in the PRC network, which is the Great Firewall. This wall has played a significant role in blocking many public opinion attacks from foreign forces for the PRC in the past era. But now, I don't know if this product of the old era is still working (or the achieve effect of their original intention). As a programmer, what I see is its negative impact on the grassroots information technology personnel of PRC. GFW has intercepted too many websites, including too many technical exchange websites, making it impossible for us to obtain help from sites with more knowledge and forcing us to build cars behind closed doors. It brings is an increasingly malformed ZH-CN network (embodied in "network autism" and "network Literary inquisition"), and increasingly more and Extreme Patriots.

This project does not reflect any views of the developers, and this software is only used as a practice project for the developers. But it does look good because my Android software interface layout is getting better and better.
